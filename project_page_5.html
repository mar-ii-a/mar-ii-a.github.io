                    Our team was working on the Pearson Airport Terminal 3 Project for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.
                    I jumped on the team and immediately began to create presentation material such as diagrams, renderings, and drawings using software such as Revit, Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, and Rhino. <br> <br>

                    As the project progressed, I joined a small core team focused on the design of the main atrium and passenger experience. Under heavy time constraints, I created mock-up visualizations for the team and consultants to understand the complex space in three dimensions with live digital walkthroughs. 
                    This allowed our team and the engineering teams to better collaborate to create a beautiful experience for our client and the end users. <br> <br>
                    
                    I had the opportunity to lead the early design model due to my software experience. Additionally, I conducted design research of building codes and equipment to create a feasible design with a positive passenger experience.

                    Maria proved to be a fast and eager learner. She demonstrated a very good grasp of technology and
                    managed to utilize software tools efficient and effectively. Through the process of creating virtual models
                    and visualizations for this project, she developed a very good sense of space, light and the impact of a
                    variety of architectural components.<br> <br>

                    While her project involvement was focused on conceptual design aspects, Maria didn’t shy away from
                    design research. She proactively sought to learn about building codes, the application to her particular
                    design challenges, and she started learning the basics of using Revit as a drawing production tool.
                    Maria consistently went above and beyond the tasks given. She was a knowledgeable student and valuable
                    and productive member of the team. I wish her all the best for her future career, which I am convinced will
                    be successful.” <br> <br>
