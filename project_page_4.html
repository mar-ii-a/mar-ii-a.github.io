                    During my work term at Parkin Architects, I worked on a many healthcare centred projects from a cancer centre and seven-storey hospital in Nova Scotia to strategic master plan of the Kitchener-Waterloo hospital in Ontario. <br> <br>

                    I collaborated with multiple teams and took on different roles throughout my time at Parkin. Early on I worked on the design of a cancer centre and created modular design components to simply the design and construction of numerous rooms in the building. 
                    Later, I took a leading role in the swapping of hundred of pieces of equipment and their data and coordinated with consultants to meet the userâ€™s needs and desires. <br> <br>
                    
                    Afterwards, I worked with senior interior designers to create interior visualizations using Revit and SketchUpfor stakeholder and user group meetings for key areas of a 7 story hospital.
                    I also worked in detail on the design of an OR room and created presentation material so design team and surgeons could communicate to create an ideal layout for their use. <br> <br>

                    I was also given the opportunity to work on a high-level strategic master plan of 10 and 20 years of Grand River Kitchener-Waterloo hospital. I was on a small team for this project, and involved in research, design, presentations, and analysis.
                    The project began with a study of design constraints, local history, and needs of the hospital. I continued to work on analyzing the how to strategize the desired growth over time, and created presentation material to evaluate and engage the user groups and stakeholders with the design. <br>
