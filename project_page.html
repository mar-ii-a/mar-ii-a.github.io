                    For my third year Design Studio, I was tasked with creating a housing system that is designed foradaption and construction by its users.
                    This project involved secondary research and iterative designing. Our system consists of a mobile smart core which contains a kit of parts for a self-build house.</p>

                    The initial research for the project consisted of a wide evaluation of architectural systems which have adaptable both over time,
                    and through use.
                    We strived to find solutions which were either self build or hackable to understand how users can engage with architecture.

                    People from all over the world can be found
                    in Canada, practicing their own cultural traditions
                    and proudly honing their identities
                    while successfully operating within Canadian
                    society. However, certain factors in our
                    built environment and wealth distribution
                    patterns forces Canadian immigrants to remain
                    in less than satisfactory, expensive
                    and undignified housing. From small one bedroom
                    apartments housing five member families
                    to basements being occupied by seven
                    to eight young people, the plethora of cultural
                    exposure, strength of community and
                    available resources are significantly stunted
                    for immigrants who cannot afford housing
                    in a growingly steep market. The Welcome
                    Wagon, beta tested in Almonte, Ontario, is
                    a community settlement scheme which seeks
                    to provide immigrant families the ability
                    to maintain their strong cultural networks
                    while also increasing their likelihood of
                    employment, self-run businesses, home ownership
                    and class mobility. For this reason,
                    the program is specifically geared towards
                    new immigrants who are having trouble finding
                    jobs and providing a sustainable income
                    for their dependents.

                    She is a 31 year old Columbia born immigrant who, along with her six year old daughter,
                    and two middle-aged parents.

                    Her primary goals are finding a safe neighbourhood for her daughter and a community where her whole family feels like they belong and can contribute.
                    Her current pains include lack of job stability, difficulty finding affordable options in the city,
                    and an inhospitable landlord in her basement apartment. Her needs and desires include finding a place where she is able to make changes for her family
                    as they grow and easily acessible greenspace for her parents to garden or homestead.
                    She was a prior languages teacher so she is skilled in communication and translation. In Columbia, her father was a mason so she is familiar with power tools and unafraid of building, however she isn’t familiar with wood construction.

                If we were to move forward with this project, we would  beta test this with users using VR and further
                develop the 3D model we created as we were designing this system.
                Based on this feedback the system could be further refined and we would be able to verify some of the assumptions
                we had to make early on since primary reserach, such as user interviews, was not in the scope of this course.
