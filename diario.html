                        I began this study seeking to understand why people who want to keep a diary often find themselves unable to manage it. 
                        In order to answer this question, I began with secondary research from online sources to gain more background information on the problem.
                         After becoming familiar with the problem space, I conducted 8 interviews on people who have tried to use a diary and would like to create the habit 
                         of diary use to develop a persona which would help me understand the user better.
                          This information was then used for analysis of the Diario app.

                        Diario is a multi-platform diary app on android, ios and web. It offers users many different categorization and searching functions for their diary entries.
                         This is done through creating folders, tags, keywords, and moods. Users are also able to attach geographic locations and pictures.
                          The app is synced through dropbox between devices, however this feature requires a paid membership. 
                        The multilingual option is also available in Diario Pro, which costs eleven dollars annually.

                        Overall, the app does an adequate job of organizing information such that the user can find it. 
                        However, there were points of confusion for the user. They felt that the sign in was likely to be its own entity, 
                        and not part of another menu. Additionally, they were confused by some of the naming such as “multiselect” and “atlas”.
                         They also placed the template option in settings as opposed to in the top bar of the entry page. When naming the categories, 
                         the user was unsure of what to name the last one since they struggled to see the relevance of the items. <br> <br><br>

                        Overall, this app suceeds in the use of many features user were interested in such as searchability, prompts, and capacity for customization.
                         However, the usability struggles could hinder users who are struggling with motivation.
                          The app could benefit from reorganization of the information and re-evalutating the clarity of the naming. <br>
