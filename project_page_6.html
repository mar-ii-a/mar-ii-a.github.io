                    Early on in my term, I had the opportunity to lead the design on a multi-classroom renovation and conversion to a special education centre. This involved research and design into student needs, and careful considerations for feasibility with limited space and funds for the conversion. My design was approved, and after my term ended, the space was constructed. <br> <br>

                    Additionally, I provided support on other school projects by creating design options using software such as AutoCad and Sketchup. In order to create the options, I considered student circulation, budgetary requirements, and visual design principles.  <br> <br>
                    
                    For second half of my term, I worked on an office building with strong time constraints, since the building was to provide necessary space for aa company to grow. My role in the project included developing visualizations of design options, refining drawings sets, and creating material palette study boards. <br> <br>

                    I also worked on a 24 hour  design competition with the firm where we envisioned how the journey up Mount Everest could be more sustainable through small scale interventions.  <br>

                    “Maria didn’t have a lot of experience before coming to WalterFedy but was keenly interested in advancing her
                    architectural skills. She was able to advance her computer skills rapidly in the time she was here and helped
                    on many projects.<br> <br>

                    Maria was diligent and was willing to ask appropriate questions as required. Her enthusiasm for all tasks was
                    appreciated by all team members and her genuine team approach to work is a great asset.
                    We valued Maria’s involvement in our studio and would highly recommend her for a similar experience
                    elsewhere.” <br> <br>
